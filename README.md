# Sportpedia 🏀🏸🎾

Sportpedia is a responsive, web-based marketplace built using React.js, Vite, HTML, and CSS, designed to help users easily browse and purchase sports equipment.

This project served as my personal learning journey into modern front-end development, especially using React.js. I took full responsibility as the Front-End Engineer, developing core pages such as the Home, Basket, and Checkout.

## Project Overview 📋

Sportpedia offers users an intuitive and dynamic shopping experience for sports gear. Built with a focus on interactivity and performance, the site is optimized for speed using Vite and React Context API for global state management.

One of the most challenging yet rewarding parts of this project was implementing the logic to ensure that selected items in the Basket were accurately reflected in the Checkout with correct quantities and pricing, giving me real world experience in dynamic rendering and component based development.

## Features 🎯
- 🛍️ Interactive product listing and cart
- 🧮 Quantity management and price calculation on the Checkout page
- ⚡ Fast Refresh enabled via Vite + React
- 📱 Fully responsive layout for mobile and desktop devices
- 🧠 Clean codebase with ESLint rules for consistent styling
