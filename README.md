Sportpedia is a responsive, web-based marketplace built using React.js, Vite, HTML, and CSS, designed to help users easily browse and purchase sports equipment.

This project served as my personal learning journey into modern front-end development, especially using React.js. I took full responsibility as the Front-End Engineer, developing core pages such as the Home, Basket, and Checkout.
